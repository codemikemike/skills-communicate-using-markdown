# 🚀 Codemikemike Markdown Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub-powered Markdown adventure! 👋  
Let’s learn and level up, one step at a time. 😎

___

## 🔢 JavaScript Code Testing

Here’s a test snippet in JavaScript:

```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
console.log(myVar);
```


## 🧑‍💻 Bonus: Code Snippets in Different Languages

### 💻 C# Example

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from C#!");
    }
}
```

### 🧠 Rule of Thumb with code block

Always:
- Start a code block with: ```` ```language ````
- End it with: ```` ``` ````

You're doing awesome — let me know if you want to try a table or checklist next!

## HTML5 & CSS3

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Hello HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

h1 {
  color: #0077cc;
  text-align: center;
}

### 🌐 Step 4: Useful Link

Here’s a link to [GitHub's Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for more tips and tricks.

### 🔤 Step 5: Inline Code Example

Sometimes you just need to show a command like `git status` or `npm install` right in the middle of a sentence — that's where `inline code` comes in handy!
